# musicbox
A Linux Bash Script to play and compose 'beep' based music.

Currently a single BASH script file that contains the note list, single-note player, and multi-note composer.

Notes are entered in the notation of <Letter><option S=Sharp or B=Flat><Octave>
  Ex: F8 (for the F note of the 8th Octave) or EB5 (For an E flat in the 5th Octave)

When you enter composer ('c') mode, you enter the notes in order and when you type 'done' it will write out and perform a very simple 'beep' line with all the notes entered. Currently there are no length or repetition options.
